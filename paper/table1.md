### Table 1

We determined three types of multilayer networks most relevant to
spatial variables. Multilayer networks with layers defined by spatially
explicit locations, interspecific interactions, and community or
subpopulation structure. Other types of networks, such as intercontexual
networks or temporal networks, are likely only to incorporate spatial
variables in a hybrid multilayer network and considerations for
including those variables will be explored here

In table 1, we define three types of multilayer networks that *can*
incorporate spatial variables.

Multilayer networks are composed of layers, nodes, interlayer edges and
intralayer edges. Layers are

How are layers defined, nodes defined, inter layer edges

We list variables affected by spatial and social scale

We use a definition of spatial scale from LE,

social scale is
