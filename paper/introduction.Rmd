# Introduction

Animal social systems are complex and multifaceted

traditionally, animal social systems are measured using direct observation, telemetry or pit tags
interactions, e.g. grooming, aggression, etc,  between individuals are quantified by simplified measures 
and often lacking any indication of the spatial context of the interaction

recently the multilayer has been used to 

along with spatial variables, comes a large history of landscape ecology exploring and evaluating sensitivity to scale


here we'll use simulations to evaluate the impact of scale on social and spatial variables 
to better understand it's impact, implications in ML networks


# Multilayer Networks
Multilayer networks combine network layers with interlayer edges

Two main types of multilayer networks exist: multiplex networks and interconnected networks. Layers in multiplex networks consist of the same entities with each layer representing either a different type of interaction (as in multirelational networks) or a different time point or window (as in temporal networks). Layers in interconnected networks consist of the same or different entities with layers representing different subsystems (as in networks of networks), different types of entities (as in intercontextual networks), or different spatial locations (as in spatial networks) [@finn2019]. 

Of these, we have identified multirelational networks, networks of networks, intercontextual networks and spatial networks as likely to have spatial and scale considerations

# Scale
What is scale

in LE lit, how has scale been investigated

Elements of scale relevant to animal social systems, animal movement data, landcover data

Grain is this, extent is this

How might scale influence results

What kinds of spatial scale are there


# Box 1: Types of spatiotemporally explicit data

Spatial data can be 

how associations are measured: e.g. spatsoc
how relocations are categorized: e.g. landcover

Multilayer networks incoroprate spatial variables in two ways:
1. for determining association between individuals in a social system
1. for characterizing the spatial context of social systems


For example, association between individuals can be determined using georeferenced biologging devices such as radio‚Äêfrequency identification tags, radiotelemetry, and global positioning system (GPS) devices. Proximity based social networks (PBSNs) are association networks based on close proximity between individuals [@spiegel2016].
