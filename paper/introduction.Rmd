# Introduction

Animal social systems are complex and multifaceted

traditionally, animal social systems are measured using direct observation, telemetry or pit tags
interactions, e.g. grooming, aggression, etc,  between individuals are quantified by simplified measures 
and often lacking any indication of the spatial context of the interaction

recently the multilayer has been used to 

along with spatial variables, comes a large history of landscape ecology exploring and evaluating sensitivity to scale


here we'll use simulations to evaluate the impact of scale on social and spatial variables 
to better understand it's impact, implications in ML networks


# Multilayer Networks


Multilayer networks combine multiple networks layers with interlayer edges

Layers in multilayer networks can be
Animal social systems are 

What is a network

How does a ML network build on that

What kinds of ML nets exist

Which can include spatial variables


Multifaceted nature of animal social systems 
many variables having a spatial component
including landcover and habitat type
fix rate and 

spatial variables defined by 


# Scale
Scale 

in grain and extent

grain is this

extent is this
