#### From issue organisers

  - Appreciate ambition to link LE and SNA.
  - Like the idea of reviewing different kinds of spatial data relevant
    to ML framework
  - Hope simulations will be as relevant to movement and SNA data
    typically collected
  - Manuscript will be relevant to both theoreticians and empiricists

**Conservation implications**

## To add

### Introduction?

We determined three types of multilayer networks most relevant to
spatial variables. Multilayer networks with layers defined by spatially
explicit locations, interspecific interactions, and community or
subpopulation structure. Other types of networks, such as intercontexual
networks or temporal networks, are likely only to incorporate spatial
variables in a hybrid multilayer network and considerations for
including those variables will be explored here
