## Abstract
Scale remains a seminal concept in ecology. Spatial scale, for instance, has
become a central consideration in the way we understand landscape ecology and
animal space use. Meanwhile, social processes can also scale from fine-scale
interactions to co-occurrence to overlapping home ranges. Multilayer networks
promise the integration of monolayer animal social networks with the complexity
and importance of animal space use and movement in heterogeneous landscapes.
Despite the complex interplay between social networks and how animals use space,
there remains an important biological and methodological gap in our
understanding of an animal’s perception of scale, e.g., grain and extent. But
scale can affect multilayer network dynamics and how we build and interpret
them. Here, we discuss the role of scale in the context of multilayer networks
and provide a case study of caribou (*Rangifer tarandus*) to illustrate the role
of social,spatial, and temporal scale on multilayer processes. We also present
perspectives on future development and application of scale in multilayer
networks with respect to habitat selection and space use, individual fitness and
phenotypes, and movement ecology and collective movement.Effective integration
of social and spatial processes, including biologically meaningful scales,
within the context of animal social networks is an emerging area of research;
our contribution uniquely incorporates perspectives on how the social
environment and spatial processes are linked across scales in a multilayer
framework. Based on social network and behavioural ecology theory as well as our
case study, we demonstrate potential for interconnectedness among individual
animals, their social environment, and the landscapes they occupy.


## Introduction
Our inference regarding the ecological processes underlying ecological patterns
are directly linked to the scale at which they are observed [@Levin_1993;
@Allen_2015]. Animals are influenced across scales, through processes such as
species-specific as trophic interactions and resource availability
[@Legendre_1993; @Chave2013] and global climate and productivity [@Field_2009].
Multiscale ecology has been integrated into species distribution modelling
[@Elith_2009; @Mayor_2007; @Sugihara_1989], habitat selection, and food webs.
Meanwhile, in the context of animal behaviour, certain behaviours are scale
dependent, for example, acoustic communication in birds occurs over variable
spatial scales [@Luther_2009]. We posit that animal behaviour and, more
specifically, the social environment that animals experience must also be
scale-dependent.


Sociality exists across both temporal and spatial scales (Whitehead 2008). For
example, grooming requires close spatial proximity between conspecifics and
occurs over brief time periods (e.g. Carter et al. 2015), whereas social
association represents shared space use by members of the same social group
(Figure 1, Franks et al. 2010). Further, for social interactions or associations
to occur individuals must share space, and thus have overlapping home ranges. In
the context of the social environment, home range overlap is a relatively coarse
scale of sociality across which individuals share space over coarser spatial and
temporal scales (e.g. Piza-Roca et al. 2018). Although the social environment
clearly scales spatially and temporally, it remains unclear whether coarser
scales of sociality, including social association and home range overlap, vary
predictably with social interaction (Castles et al. 2014; Farine 2015). Thus, we
define social scale as the type of social relationship observed that can be
explicitly defined and measured (Farine et al. 2015).


Animal social network analysis is a well-developed tool used to measure the
relationships of individuals and organization of social systems (Krause et al.
2009; Wey et al. 2008; Croft et al. 2008). Social network analysis provides
insight into the structure of social communities and social network properties,
which can influence population dynamics and evolutionary processes
(Pinter-Wollman et al. 2014; Kurvers et al. 2014). Despite the widespread use
and innovation of traditional social network analysis (Webber & Vander Wal
2019), it typically considers a single scale of sociality in a given network
(monolayer), drastically simplifying the potential complexity of animal social
systems (Finn et al. 2019). 


Unlike traditional monolayer social networks, multilayer networks explicitly
consider social systems across contexts, including scale-dependent contexts
(Pilosof et al. 2017). Multilayer networks are made up of multiple layers, each
representing different classes of individuals (e.g. male or female), types of
behaviours (e.g. grooming, travelling, or foraging), spatial areas (e.g. local
or regional), or temporal windows (e.g. daily or seasonal) (Kivela et al. 2014;
Porter 2018). Multilayer networks are relatively novel to studies of animal
behaviour (Finn et al. 2019; Silk et al. 2018), although they have been used to
describe multidimensional human social systems, complex transportation networks,
and neural networks (Silk et al. 2018). The role of scale within multilayer
social networks remains unexplored but provides a unique opportunity to develop
novel understanding of variation in the temporal or spatial scales associated
with social systems.


Our study is motivated by behavioural, landscape, and spatial ecology to build a
conceptual and analytical framework for scale-dependent multilayer networks and
we apply this framework to a case study of caribou (*Rangifer tarandus*) in
Newfoundland, Canada (Peignier et al. 2019). We use this case study to address
two principal questions associated with scale-dependent multilayer networks.
First, to what degree does the social scale of relationships, spatial scale of
landscapes, and temporal scale of analysis influence our ability to interpret
complex social systems? Second, can variation in social, spatial, and temporal
improve predictions associated with biological differences in seasonal resource
availability and social association? We conclude with perspectives for further
development and application of scale in multilayer networks with respect to
landscape ecology (Schneider 2009), individual fitness and phenotypes (Webber &
Vander Wal 2018), and movement ecology and collective movement (Jolles et al.
2019).

## Scale in multilayer networks: a case study

### Caribou socioecology
Here, we use caribou as a case study to develop scale-dependent multilayer
networks based on social (visual and auditory perception), spatial (habitat
type), and temporal (seasonal). Caribou are gregarious ungulates with
fission-fusion dynamics (Lesmerises et al. 2018) that display temporal
[@Peignier_2019] and spatial (Webber et al. unpublished data) variation in
social networks. In winter, caribou dig holes in the snow, termed craters, to
access forage (Bergerud 1974). As a result, caribou tend to occupy and re-use
craters once they are established and there is considerably less access to
forage than when the landscape is snow-free. Importantly, craters exist on the
landscape at multiple scales: the crater scale (a single crater), the feeding
area scale (multiple craters in close proximity), and the winter range scale
(all craters within an individual’s range) [@Mayor_2009]. The distribution of
forage for caribou is therefore seasonally heterogeneous, with greater access in
snow-free seasons compared to winter as well as spatially heterogeneous in
winter because the distribution of craters on the landscape varies meaning that
access to vegetation in winter is highly variable for caribou. We therefore
partitioned data into two discrete seasons:  *summer (3 August - 20 September)
and winter (1 January – 17 February)* based on caribou socioecology
[@Peignier_2019].

### Caribou location data
We used GPS location data collected from Fogo Island caribou in 2017 and 2018.
Adult female caribou were immobilized and fitted with global positioning system
(GPS) collars (Lotek Wireless Inc., Newmarket, ON, Canada, GPS4400M collars,
1,250 g) as described by Schaefer and Mahoney (2013). Collars were programmed to
collect location fixes every 2 hours. Prior to analyses, we subset GPS fixes
into a discrete removed all erroneous and outlier GPS fixes following Bjørneraas
et al. (2010). We did not collar all female caribou in the herd; however, we
assumed that our sample of collared animals was random.

### Landscape data and habitat classification
Landscape classification data were provided by the Newfoundland and Labrador
Wildlife Division. Available landcover classification included nine habitat
types at <!-- TODO: double check --> 30m resolution. We reclassified the
landcover types into three categories: foraging habitat, open habitat, and
forest habitat. Foraging habitat consisted of lichen habitat, open habitat
consisted of wetland, rocky barrens, and anthropogenic habitat types, while
forest habitat consisted of coniferous forest, conifer scrub, broadleaf forest,
and mixed-wood forest habitat types. Water habitat was excluded from all
subsequent analyses.
<!-- using the raster package for R? -->

### Caribou multilayer social networks

#### Network types and construction (defining layers for the multilayer network)

We generated seasonal multilayer social networks consisting of habitat-specific
monolayers. Each layer was the social association network generated in one of
three habitat types (lichen, open, and forest). For habitat-specific networks,
all GPS relocations were assigned to the corresponding habitat type and
proximity-based social network layers were generated using the R package spatsoc
(Robitaille et al. 2019) in *R version* (R Core Team 2020).

Within each habitat-specific monolayer network, we assumed individuals were
associating if simultaneous GPS fixes (i.e., recorded within 5 minutes of each
other) were within a given distance of one another. Typically for ungulates and
other gregarious mammals, the ‘chain rule’ is applied for group assignment. For
GPS data, the chain rule is applied if discrete spatiotemporal GPS fixes
buffered by a given distance formed a contiguous buffer for two or more
individuals, even if some individuals within the buffer were not within the
given distance of one another (Robitaille et al. 2019). Group assignment based
on the chain rule has previously been applied to caribou at a distance of 50m
(Peignier et al. 2019; Lesmerises et al. 2018). In all networks, nodes
represented individuals, intralayer edges represented associations between
individuals in a given habitat type, and interlayer edges represented
connections between the same individuals across contexts.

We weighted edges of social networks by the strength of association between
caribou using the simple ratio index (SRI, Cairns and Schwager 1987):

$$ SRI = \frac{x}{x + y_{AB} + y_{A} + y_{B}} $$

where x is the number of fixes where individuals A and B were within a given
distance of each other, $y_{A}$ is the number of fixes from individual A
when individual B did not have a simultaneous fix, $y_{B}$ is the number
of fixes from individual B when individual A did not have a simultaneous fix,
and $y_{AB}$ is the number of simultaneous fixes from individuals A and B
that were separated by more than the given distance (Farine & Whitehead 2015).
Social groups were designated if two or more individuals occurred within a given
distance of one another at any given time point.

#### Network metrics

For each multilayer network, we calculated four metrics.These included:
multidegree, graph strength, redundancy/relevance, and  layer similarity.

* Multidegree
* Degree centrality
* Multidegree
* Degree deviation: standard deviation of degree across layers
* Neighbors/neighborhood (number of unique actors directly connected to each focal): Neighbors = degree within a network layer. But across a multilayer network with multiple layers, some neighbors are repeated. 
* Graph strength
* Connective redundancy: 1 - (neighborhood / degree) When connective redundancy is 0, all edges on all layers are necessary to preserve the social ties
* Relevance: neighborhood of specific layer  / neighbourhood of full ml net. This is the proportion of neighbors present on the layer of focus. Comparing across, it tells you which layers are most important for each individual. 
* layer similarity



### Varying scale in multilayer networks

#### Social scale

We altered social scale based on visual (short distance) and auditory (long
distnace) sensory modalities of caribou <!--(REF?)-->. Specifically, we modified the
distance threshold required for group assignment (see above) and re-assigned
groups at incremental distance between 5-500m. For example, at the finest social
scale, only individuals within 5m of one another were considered in the same
group, whereas at the coarset social scale, only individuals within 500m of one
another were considered in the same group.

#### Spatial scale

To assess the influence of spatial scale on multilayer networks, we re-sampled
our landcover classification map at varying scales. Specifically, we selected
scales relevant to caribou ecology. We re-sampled landcover using the
`grainchanger` **package** (Graham 2019) at **five** scales: 100m, 250m, 500m,
1000m, 2500m. Sampling at 100 and 250m represents fine-scale decision making for
caribou during foraging <!--(REF)-->, while re-sampling at 1000m and 2500m represents
the scale at which caribou tend to select and avoid habitat (Bastille-Rousseau
et al. 2017). Resampling occurred based on a modal moving window method, where
**XXXXX. [ALEC YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ADD DETAIL HERE]**

For each landcover (the original resolution and modal resampled resolutions),
seasonal network layers are combined in a multilayer network <!-- Each modal
landcover, and the original are sampled and separate network layers constructed
for each. **[QW: NOT SURE WHAT THIS MEANS]** -->

#### Temporal scale

We altered the temporal scale of mutlilayer networks using a moving time-window
approach to define seasons.

1. time window length

Varying length of time window (used to define seasons). Starting with a window
of day 1-40 and using a moving window to go to day 1-100. Fixed start julian day
for winter is day 1 and for summer is 215. Network layers for winter and summer
are calculated for each window length.


1. time window position
Varying position of time window (used to define seasons). Fixed length at 48
Window positions starting at 1, to + 48 So 1-48 is first iteration for winter
and 48-96 is second iteration for "winter". Same for summer, starting at 215.
Network layers for each season are constructed.

**Observational scale** <!--(temorary header)-->: Studies of social network analysis
vary in the number and frequency of observations as well as the data collection
technique used to generate networks (Davis et al. 2018; Webber and Vander Wal
2019).

Randomly select max number of observations - timegroups - <!-- (right now 750)-->. For
each iteration, include n observations for each season for all individuals.
Subsequent iterations include nstep more <!--(right now 25)-->, along with previously
included to remove stochasticity. Parallels with observation data.


## Scale in multilayer networks in practice: case study results and discussion

### Each metric's interpretation
* Multidegree: sum of degree across layers. High multidegree = connected to many
individuals across layers. Low multidegree = not connected to many individuals
across layers.

* Degree deviation: deviation of degree across layers. High degree deviation =
large difference between degree for an individual across layers. Low degree
deviation = individuals are similarly connected across layers.

* Graph strength: weighted version of degree. High graph strength = highly
connected. Not summed in this case across layers.

* Neighbors: number of unique individuals adjacent to each actor. Considered in
a single layer, this is equal to the degree.

* Neighborhood: number of unique individuals across all layers. High
neighborhood = a high number of unique individuals connected to an actor. 

* Relevance: layer centric metric, corresponding to the number of neighbors on a
layer divided by the total neighborhood for each actor. High relevance means
that the layer is highly relevant to the individuals connections. A low
relevance means this layer does not contribute many neighbors to an individuals
overall neighborhood.

* Connective redundancy: the total multilayer neighborhood divided by the
multidegree. High connective redundancy indicates a multilayer network that has
many repeated edges across layers between an actor and its neighbours. Low
connective redundancy indicates that each layer is important for preserving all
social ties.

* Layer similarily: how similar each layer is (Brodka 2018). Pearson's
correlation coefficient of degree vectors for each layer, comparing each
landcover across seasons.



### Figure captions and brief interpretations


(ref:lcres) varying scale in landcover resolution. For each landcover resolution (10m, 100m, 250m, 500m and 1000m), ultilayer networks were constructed for each landcover class (open, forest and lichen) across two seasons (winter and summer) and four network metrics calculated. A) Similarity of landcover network layers between seasons (e.g.: open summer compared to open winter) showed different responses to changing landcover scale with an increase in similarity for forest layers at 250m and decrease in similarity for open layers at 250m. Note that lichen layer similarity is not shown because individuals did not interact in lichen habitats greater greater than 10m landcover resolution. B) Mean connective redundancy across individuals showed a decreasing trend with increasing landcover resolution. C) Mean layer relevance and D) mean graph strength across individuals showed sparse connectivity in summer compared to winter networks and a decrease in winter lichen layer relevance at higher landcover resolutions.


```{r, fig.cap='(ref:lcres)'}
knitr::include_graphics('../graphics/figure-lcres.png')
```


* decreasing availability of patchy lichen = no edges in these layers, though some small proportion of relocations still exist in those layers
* decreasing connective redundancy because through resolution because lichen decreased in connectivity and landcovers became more homogeneous (?)
* decreasing winter lichen relevance because the degree + number of edges decreased



(ref:socres) varying scale in social threshold. For each social threshold (5m, 50m, 100m, 150m, 200m, 250m, 300m, 350m, 400m, 450m, 500m), multilayer networks were constructed for each landcover class (open, forest and lichen) across two seasons (winter and summer) and four network metrics calculated. A) Similarity of landcover network layers between seasons (e.g.: open summer compared to open winter) showed different responses to changing landcover scale with an overall increase in similarity for open layers and decrease in similarity for lichen layers. B) Mean connective redundancy across individuals increased rapidly between 5m and 50m reaching a plateau around 0.65 before decrease between 400m and 500m. C) Mean layer relevance was relatively stable across social thresholds for each season and landcover layer. D) Mean graph strength across individuals showed an increase for winter network layers at 50m through 500m while summer network layers remained consistently sparse.


```{r, fig.cap='(ref:socres)'}
knitr::include_graphics('../graphics/figure-spatialthreshold.png')
```


* increasing layer relevance as more individuals are connected with increasing buffer size
* decrease in connective redundancy due an increase in summer forest degree at the last (500m) social threshold
* increasing graph strength consistent with increasing strength in winter





(ref:winlen) varying scale in time window length. For each time windown length (of a sequence from 40 to 100 by 5), multilayer networks were constructed for each landcover class (open, forest and lichen) across two seasons (winter and summer) and four network metrics calculated. A) Similarity of landcover network layers between seasons (e.g.: open summer compared to open winter) showed increasing similarity consistent across landcover layers with increasing window length. B) Mean connective redundancy across individuals increased rapidly between 5m and 50m reaching a plateau around 0.65 before decrease between 400m and 500m. C) Mean layer relevance was relatively stable across social thresholds for each season and landcover layer. D) Mean graph strength across individuals showed an increase for winter network layers at 50m through 500m while summer network layers remained consistently sparse.


* increasing window length = increasingly similar layers and increasingly redundant edges. more individuals have the opportunity to interact
* increasing window length also leads to increasing similarity between seasons because seasons are less well defined/include more shoulder seasons
* decreasing graph strength at the upper end of window length in winter showing again inclusion of more shoulder season
* layers are more similarly relevant at high window length

knitr::include_graphics('../graphics/figure-winlength.png')
```




<!-- RO first sentence... -->

(ref:nobs) varying scale in number of observations. For each iteration, a number of observations (10-485 observations in steps of 25) were selected from the complete dataset to construct multilayer networks with layers defined by each landcover class (open, forest and lichen) across two seasons (winter and summer) and four network metrics calculated. A) Similarity of landcover network layers between seasons (e.g.: open summer compared to open winter) showed a stabilizing layer similarity at 200 observations for forest and 300 observations for lichen and open. B) Mean connective redundancy across individuals increased with increasing number of observations, with a decreasing rate of increase around 100 observations. C) Mean layer relevance across individuals increased for winter layers and slightly increased for summer layers. D) Mean graph strength across individuals varied for winter layers becoming relatively stable at 200 observations and remained sparse throughout for summer layers.


* common, though at different points - more observations until stabilizing
* we dont see the stabilizing/full plateau for connective redundancy but appears to be coming.. 
* still some variability, especially for graph strength because individuals are differently connected but broad strokes - they stabilize with more observations



```{r, fig.cap='(ref:nobs)'}
knitr::include_graphics('../graphics/figure-nobs.png')
```


(ref:winpos) varying scale in time window position. For each time windown position (of a sequence from 1 to 48), the time window used to define seasons was shifted and multilayer networks were constructed for each landcover class (open, forest and lichen) across two seasons (winter and summer) and four network metrics calculated. A) Similarity of landcover network layers between seasons (e.g.: open summer compared to open winter) showed increasing similarity consistent across landcover layers with increasing window length. B) Mean connective redundancy across individuals increased between window position 12 through 48 due to increased connectivity in the summer network layers. C) Mean layer relevance decreased for winter layers and increased for summer layers, showing greater connectivity in summer layers at later window positions. D) Mean graph strength across individuals increased in summer network layers at window position 25 and increased between window position 20 and 40 for winter network layers.


* increasing network connectivity in summer when the window position is moved - these seasons are more similar than the original window position
* same theme shown in the connective redundancy
* quite variable layer similarity, not sure what to pull out of that one
* increased graph strength for winter down the middle, with generally increasing summer layers - again where the season is including more shoulder season potentially

### Individual fitness and phenotypes

Social network positions are frequently used to represent the social environment
that an individual experiences or their social phenotype. Social phenotypes are
increasingly linked to important fitness for individuals of various species,
including primates (e.g. Brent, Ruiz-Lambides, & Platt, 2017; Thompson, 2019),
dolphins (e.g. Stanton & Mann, 2012; Stanton, Gibson, & Mann, 2011), and birds
(e.g. McDonald, 2007; Royle, Pike, Heeb, Richner, & Kolliker, 2012). The effect
of scale on the relationship between an individual’s social network position and
fitness may depend on the hypotheses being tested and logistical constraints.
Two scales that are important for understanding fitness consequences in the
context of social network positions are temporal and social scales (Almeling,
Hammerschmidt, Sennhenn-Reulen, Freund, & Fischer, 2016; Berger, Lemaître,
Allainé, Gaillard, & Cohas, 2015; Brent et al., 2017).


Social network structure depends on the timeframe of observation, which can make
networks difficult to compare (Castles et al., 2014). Furthermore, social
network structure can vary seasonally and indicate social environments that an
individual experiences (e.g. Brent, MacLarnon, Platt, & Semple, 2013; Hamede,
Bashford, McCallum, & Jones, 2009; Holekamp, Smith, Strelioff, Van Horn, &
Watts, 2012), or they can be consistent across time, which can be used to
reflect social phenotypes (Aplin et al., 2015; Stanley, Mettke-Hofmann, Hager, &
Shultz, 2018). Seasonal fluctuations have the potential to have disease
transmission and fitness effects for individuals (Balasubramaniam et al., 2019;
Chen et al., 2014). <!-- **[QW: I'm not sure what this paragraph adds - I think if we
need to save space we could cut it]**-->


In long-lived species, social phenotypes can change over their lifetimes in ways
that can affect fitness (Berger et al., 2015; Brent et al., 2017). These
findings highlight the necessity to carefully consider the temporal scale that
is meaningful for the proposed hypotheses, especially for understanding the
relationship between an individuals social phenotype and fitness. Further
complicating the issue, social phenotypes can change over stages of ontogeny,
although it is important to note that individuals progress through development
at different rates (Tarka, Guenther, Niemelä, Nakagawa, & Noble, 2018). This
variation can make defining appropriate temporal scales for testing the fitness
implications of an individual’s social phenotype over different stages of
ontogeny even more difficult. However, considering fine temporal scales may
provide insight across development stages that may otherwise be missed
(CITE-myself??). Multilayer networks provide a framework to test hypotheses
linking social phenotypes and fitness across temporal scales. Because of the
non-independent nature of social interactions and associations, especially over
time, it is hard to test hypotheses about social dynamics with a suitable null
control (Farine, 2017; Proskurnikov & Tempo, 2017). Using the framework of
multilayer networks, making layers of different temporal periods provides a way
to make appropriate null models to test questions about the dynamics of an
individual’s social network position over multiple aggregated time periods.


Social scale is another major consideration for social network analysis,
especially in the context of different types of interactions and associations in
the same analysis (Carter, Lee, & Marshall, 2015; Castles et al., 2014; Farine,
2015). It is a common trope that individuals must be associating to interact and
most studies therefore assume that proximity is proxy for interacting (Farine,
2015). For instance, baboons need to be in proximity in order to groom each
other, but this trope highlights human bias toward interactions that can be
readily observed in the field. Animals have certain interactions that do not
require proximity such as long-distance vocalization and olfactory signals
(Carter et al., 2015). With the advancement of bio-logging technology, we have
the ability to record social interactions that do not require proximity,
particularly long-distance communication networks with devices like microphone
arrays (Snijders & Naguib, 2017). The multilayer network framework further
enables researchers to examine the relationship between social phenotypes and
fitness across social scales and to test how good social proximity is as a proxy
for social interactions in a holistic way.


These different social scales can have different fitness repercussions for
individuals. Rhesus macaques (*Macaca mulatta*) that had stronger, more stable
social associates and grooming partners, but not more social partners, had
higher survivorship than those who did not (Ellis, Snyder-Mackler,
Ruiz-Lambides, Platt, & Brent, 2019). This finding highlights the need to
investigate the effect of temporal and social scales on the relationship between
social network positions and fitness. Multilayer networks provide an avenue to
do so considering the whole social system rather than just one type of social
interaction at a time, which is what has been done under most circumstances but
is not very realistic.


Multilayer networks further provide unique challenges and opportunities for
understanding the social phenotypes and environments of individuals and their
fitness outcomes. Picking the proper temporal scale is important but a challenge
because all layers in the multilayer network should reflect the same time
period, and the period should be long enough for each layer to have enough data
for robust networks (Farine, 2017). These considerations may be limiting factors
when answering questions that require timeframes that are relevant to different
individuals. On the other hand, multilayer network metrics provide an
opportunity to simplify statistical models. Interactions that happen meters
apart, proximity associations, and long-distance interactions can be
encapsulated in a single multilayer network, and a single metric can be used to
describe the various social scales of an individual’s network position. This
multilevel network metric could be used to assess the relationship between an
individual's social phenotype and fitness. It would also be a meaningful
simplification of many network metrics that could help simplify statistical
analyses and deal with the frequent correlations between social network metrics
in different types of networks (Castles et al., 2014).



### Movement ecology and collective movement

Animal movement undoubtedly affects an individual's social environment
(Strandburg-Peshkin et al. 2015). Movement is a dynamic process that is related
to the resources an individual consumes within their home range and the space
that they use (Van Moorter et al. 2016). Collective movement can reduce
group-level predation via detection-dilution trade-offs and improve information
transfer about the quality or location of resources to other group members
(Jolles et al. 2019). Social processes, movement decisions, and space use are
inextricably linked and multilayer networks represent a potential analytical
framework for linking these processes (e.g. Mourier et al. 2019).


Although multilayer animal social networks are relatively novel (Silk et al.
2018), movement behaviour within multilayer networks has already been considered
in a couple studies. In vulturine gunieafowl (*Acryllium vulturinum*), GPS
movement data were used to generate *monolayer* association networks within a
multilayer network (Papageorgiou et al. 2019). In addition, *spatial networks*
are physical locations (nodes) which are connected in a network when individuals
move between said locations (edges). For example, spatial networks were applied
to monitor movement of sharks (*Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos* and *Carcharhinus
melanopterus*) between fixed location autonomous arrays. In this example, nodes
represent locations within the array, *intralayer edges* represent individual
movement frequency, and *interlayer edges* represent contact probability among
individuals at a given node (Mourier et al. 2019). While both studies integrate
movement in some capacity, neither generate networks based on continuous
measures of dyadic or collective movement (Long et al. 2014).


In contrast to spatial networks, where nodes represent spatial locations that
are fixed in space, movement networks can represent continuous and simultaneous
movement trajectories of multiple animals. Continuous collection of animal
relocation data using GPS technology can be used to measure how groups of
animals make collective movement decisions in the context of their local
environment (Strandburg-Peshkin et al. 2015, 2017) and across scales. A
collective movement layer could constitute similarity in movement for dyads
(Long et al. 2014) or groups (Bode et al. 2011). This movement layer could be
made at a fine (i.e. minute-to-minute: Cleasby et al. 2019) or coarse scale
(global migration: Flack et al. 2018). Another potential application would be to
generate social networks during times when animals are engaged in different
behaviours, including traveling, interacting, or foraging (e.g. Muller et al.
2018; Finn et al. 2019) and construct a multilayer network based on
behaviour-specific monolayer networks (e.g. Smith-Aguilar et al. 2019).
Importantly, the key to incorporating movement in multilayer networks across
scales is the technological advancements available to overcome previous
limitations (see Hughey et al. 2018).


Given the existing framework for constructing multilayer networks from
behavioural layers (e.g. Smith-Aguilar et al. 2019), movement layers could be
integrated with interaction or association layers. Integrating movement layers
with habitat-specific social association layers could further shed light on the
role of movement as a driver of the social and spatial environments an
individual experiences (Webber and Vander Wal 2018). In our case study, we
generated multilayer networks based on habitat-specific monolayers. Coordinated
movement of dyads, or groups, could vary based on habitat, and the approach we
outline could be used to explore mechanisms linking the social and spatial
environments. For example, social processes may be an emergent property of the
landscape because animals aggregate at resources, such as waterholes
(Chamaillé-Jammes et al. 2008). Movement to, from, or within habitat patches  or
territories can also contribute to the formation of the social environment
(Spiegel et al. 2016). For example, in sleepy lizards (*Tiliqua rugosa*) males
interacted primarily at home range edges, presumably driving territorial
behaviour (Spiegel et al. 2018). Incorporating movement ecology within a
multilayer network framework is a logical next step for a burgeoning field. In
particular, when association networks are habitat-specific, we suggest the
integration of movement and space use in multilayer networks provides novel
insights into the effects of habitat configuration on the formation of the
social environment (He et al. 2019).





## Conclusions

something something blah blah.

Silk et al. (2018) presented some key multilayer questions in animal behaviour
research. While these questions represent an important starting point for
multilayer networks, we present an additional set of questions relevant to the
promise and problem of scale in mutlilayer networks:

1. How do social phenotypes across scales differently influence fitness? Are
some temporal or social scales better predictors for different fitness metrics?

1. Why do individuals associate more strongly with certain conspecifics in some
habitats? What, if any, is the role of movement in the context of habitat
networks?

1. How, and why, does the spatial scale of perception influence, e.g. auditory,
visual, or chemotaxis, influence the  social environment across scales? What is
the role of memory, and by extension social and spatial cognition, as animals
navigate their environment and make decisions about where to move next?
