# Abstract
Scale remains a foundational concept in ecology. Spatial scale, for instance,
has become a central consideration in the way we understand landscape ecology
and animal space use. Meanwhile, social processes can also scale from fine-scale
interactions to co-occurrence to overlapping home ranges. Multilayer networks
promise the integration of monolayer animal social networks with the complexity
and importance of animal space use and movement in heterogeneous landscapes.
Despite the complex interplay between social networks and how animals use space,
there remains an important biological and methodological gap in our
understanding of an animal’s perception of scale. But scale can affect
multilayer network dynamics and how we build and interpret them. Here we discuss
the role of scale in the context of multilayer networks and provide a social
ungulate case study to illustrate the role of social, spatial, and temporal
scale on multilayer processes. We also present perspectives on future
development and application of scale in multilayer networks with respect to:
habitat selection and space use; phenotypes and individual fitness; and movement
ecology and collective movement. Effective integration of social and spatial
processes, including biologically meaningful scales, within the context of
animal social networks is an emerging area of research; our contribution
incorporates perspectives on how the social environment and spatial processes
are linked across scales in a multilayer

# Introduction
Our inference regarding the ecological processes underlying ecological patterns
are directly linked to the scale at which they are observed [@Levin_1992;
@Allen_2015]. Animals are influenced across scales, through processes such as
species-specific as trophic interactions and resource availability
[@Legendre_1993; @Chave_2013] and global climate and productivity [@Field_2009].
Multiscale ecology has been integrated into species distribution modelling
[@Elith_2009], habitat selection [@Mayor_2007], and food webs [@Sugihara_1989].
Meanwhile, in the context of animal behaviour, certain behaviours are scale
dependent, for example, acoustic communication in birds occurs over variable
spatial scales [@Luther_2009]. We posit that animal behaviour and, more
specifically, the social environment that animals experience must also be
scale-dependent.

Sociality exists across both temporal and spatial scales (Whitehead 2008). For
example, grooming requires close spatial proximity between conspecifics and
occurs over brief time periods [e.g. @Carter_2015], whereas social association
represents shared space use by members of the same social group [Figure 1,
@Franks_2009]. <!--Figure \@ref(fig:spacetime) TODO: something broken here?? -->
Further, for social interactions or associations to occur individuals must share
space, and thus have overlapping home ranges. In the context of the social
environment, home range overlap is a relatively coarse scale of sociality across
which individuals share space over coarser spatial and temporal scales [e.g.
@Piza_Roca_2018]. Although the social environment clearly scales spatially and
temporally, it remains unclear whether coarser scales of sociality, including
social association and home range overlap, vary predictably with social
interaction [@Castles_2014; @Farine_2015a]. Thus, we define social scale as the
type of social relationship observed that can be explicitly defined and measured
[@Farine_2015a]. <!-- Farine references comes out as D.R. Farine 2015 -->

Animal social network analysis is a well-developed tool used to measure the
relationships of individuals and organization of social systems [@Krause_2009;
@Wey_2008; @Croft_2011]. Social network analysis provides insight into the
structure of social communities and social network properties, which can
influence population dynamics and evolutionary processes [@Pinter_Wollman_2013;
@Kurvers_2014]. Despite the widespread use and innovation of traditional social
network analysis [@Webber_2019], it typically considers a single scale of
sociality in a given network (monolayer), drastically simplifying the potential
complexity of animal social systems [@Finn_2019].


Unlike traditional monolayer social networks, multilayer networks explicitly
consider social systems across contexts, including scale-dependent contexts
[@Pilosof_2017]. Multilayer networks are made up of multiple layers, each
representing (i) different classes of individuals, e.g. male or female; (ii)
types of behaviours, e.g. grooming, travelling, or foraging; and (iii) spatial
areas, e.g. local or regional, or temporal windows, e.g. daily or seasonal
[@Kivela_2014; @Porter_2018]. Multilayer networks are relatively novel to
studies of animal behaviour [@Silk_2018; @Finn_2019], although they have been
used to describe multidimensional human social systems, complex transportation
networks, and neural networks [@Silk_2018]. The role of scale within multilayer
social networks remains unexplored but provides a unique opportunity to develop
novel understanding of variation in the temporal or spatial scales associated
with social systems.


Our study is motivated by behavioural, landscape, and spatial ecology to build a
conceptual and analytical framework for scale-dependent multilayer networks and
we apply this framework to a case study of caribou (*Rangifer tarandus*) in
Newfoundland, Canada [@Peignier_2019]. We use this case study to address two
principal questions associated with scale-dependent multilayer networks. First,
to what degree does the social scale of relationships, spatial scale of
landscapes, and temporal scale of analysis influence our ability to interpret
complex social systems? Second, can variation in the social, spatial, and
temporal scale improve predictions associated with biological differences in seasonal
resource availability and social association? We conclude with perspectives for
further development and application of scale in multilayer networks with respect
to phenotypes and individual fitness [@Webber_2018], movement ecology and
collective movement [@Jolles_2019], and habitat selection and space use. <!--

(ref:spacetime) Space-time diagram displaying variation the relative spatial and
temporal extent required for different types of social and communication
processes for four species, including hyaena, passerine birds, sleepy lizards,
and elephants. Spatial and temporal extent for social interactions, e.g. mating,
grooming, or aggression, are similar for most species because physical contact
between two individuals is required for most social interactions. The logical
extension is that spatial and temporal extent for social interaction is nested
within the spatial and temporal extent for social association because
individuals must shared space to interact. By contrast, different species have
potential for  greater spatial and temporal extents, for example, temporal
extent for vocal communication is similar for most species because most vocal
calls only persist in the environment for seconds, but spatial extent for vocal
communication is highly variable with elephant calls extending the great
distance and passerine calls extending the shortest distance.

# Scale in multilayer networks: a case study

## Caribou socioecology
Here, we use caribou as a case study to develop scale-dependent multilayer
networks based on predicted social (visual and auditory perception), spatial
(habitat type), and temporal (seasonal) scales. Caribou are gregarious ungulates
with fission-fusion dynamics [@Lesmerises_2018] that display temporal and
spatial variation in social networks [@Peignier_2019]. In winter, caribou dig
holes in the snow, termed craters, to access forage [@Bergerud_1974]. Cratering
is presumed to be a costly behaviour and as a result, caribou tend to occupy and
re-use craters once they are established and there is considerably less access
to forage than when the landscape is snow-free. Importantly, craters exist on
the landscape at multiple scales: the crater scale (a single crater), the
feeding area scale (multiple craters in close proximity), and the winter range
scale (all craters within an individual’s range) [@Mayor_2009]. The distribution
of forage for caribou is therefore seasonally heterogeneous because the
distribution of craters on the landscape varies meaning that access to
vegetation in winter is highly variable for caribou. Caribou therefore have
greater access to forage in snow-free seasons. We  partitioned data into two
discrete seasons: summer (3 August - 20 September 2017) and winter (1 January – 17
February 2018) based on caribou socioecology [@Peignier_2019].

## Caribou location data
We used GPS location data collected from Fogo Island caribou in 2017 and 2018.
Adult female caribou were immobilized and fitted with global positioning system
(GPS) collars (Lotek Wireless Inc., Newmarket, ON, Canada, GPS4400M collars,
1,250 g) as described by [@Schaefer_2013]. Collars were programmed to collect
location fixes every 2 hours. Prior to analyses, we subset GPS fixes into a
discrete removed all erroneous and outlier GPS fixes following
[@BJ_RNERAAS_2010] <!--TODO: fix this ref-->. We did not collar all female
caribou in the herd; however, the proportion of marked adult females was
approximately 15% and we assumed these individuals were randomly distributed
throughout the population.

## Landscape data and habitat classification
Landcover data were provided by the Newfoundland and Labrador Wildlife Division.
Available landcover classification included nine habitat types at <!-- TODO:
double check lc res--> 30 m resolution. We reclassified the landcover types into
three categories: foraging habitat, open habitat, and forest habitat using the R
package `raster` [@Hijmans_2019]. Foraging habitat consisted of lichen habitat,
open habitat consisted of wetland, rocky barrens, and anthropogenic habitat
types, while forest habitat consisted of coniferous forest, conifer scrub,
broadleaf forest, and mixed-wood forest habitat types. Water habitat was
excluded from all subsequent analyses.


## Caribou multilayer social networks

### Network types and construction (defining layers for the multilayer network)
<!-- TODO: should use something like "using syntax from Kivela 2014..." or 
Following [@Kivela_2014]:
other info to maybe include: the multilayer network was not node-aligned since
not all individuals were on all layers
the temporal aspect is ordinal coupling and landcover aspect is categorical coupling

Individuals were subset to ensure they had data collected in both seasons
-->

We generated a multilayer social network consisting 16 individual nodes and two
aspects (season and landcover). Two season elementary-layers (winter and summer)
and three landcover elementary-layers (forest, forage, and open) combined for a
total of six layers. Layers were composed of individuals represented as nodes
and social associations represented as edges, for each season and landcover
combination. Proximity-based social network layers were generated using the R
package `spatsoc` [@Robitaille_2019] in `r version$version.string`
[@R_Core_Team_2019]. <!-- TODO: FIX VANDER WAL IN SPATSOC REF -->

Within each layer, we assumed individuals were associating if simultaneous GPS
fixes, i.e., recorded within 5 minutes of each other, were within a given
spatial distance of one another. Typically for ungulates and other gregarious
mammals, the ‘chain rule’ is applied for group assignment. For GPS data, the
chain rule is applied if discrete spatiotemporal GPS fixes buffered by a given
distance formed a contiguous buffer for two or more individuals, even if some
individuals within the buffer were not within the given distance of one another
[@Robitaille_2019]. Group assignment based on the chain rule has previously been
applied to caribou at a distance of 50 m [@Peignier_2019; @Lesmerises_2018]. In
all networks, nodes represented individuals, intralayer edges represented
associations between individuals in a given habitat type and season, and
interlayer edges represented connections between the same individuals across
contexts (Figure 2).

We weighted edges of social networks by the strength of association between
caribou using the simple ratio index (SRI, Cairns and Schwaeger 1987): 
<!-- TODO: get Cairns ref-->

$$ SRI = \frac{x}{x + y_{AB} + y_{A} + y_{B}} $$

where x is the number of fixes where individuals A and B were within a given
distance of each other, $y_{A}$ is the number of fixes from individual A when
individual B did not have a simultaneous fix, $y_{B}$ is the number of fixes
from individual B when individual A did not have a simultaneous fix, and
$y_{AB}$ is the number of simultaneous fixes from individuals A and B that were
separated by more than the given distance [@Farine_2015]. Social groups were
designated if two or more individuals occurred within a given distance of one
another at any given time point.

### Network metrics 

<!-- TODO: expand + simplify + examples individual A, B etc --> 
<!-- TODO: EVW "parallelism"? -->

We used a series of metrics to characterize the multilayer networks, focusing on
the role of individuals, importance of individual layers and the similarity of
different layers. To measure the role of individuals, we calculated degree
centrality and graph strength. Degree centrality is the number of direct
connections an individual has to other individuals in a network layer. Graph
strength is the degree weighted by the strength of association, in this case
SRI, in each layer-specific season and landcover context <!-- TODO: citation for
graph strength?-->. Extending degree centrality, we calculated multidegree, the
sum of degree centrality across layers, and neighbourhood, the sum of unique
neighbours to each individual [@Berlingerio_2012; @Kivela_2014]. We evaluated
the relevance and redundancy of layers by combining the multidegree and
neighbourhood to calculate connective redundancy and layer relevance. Connective
redundancy is the proportion of neighbours repeated in multiple layers, and
layer relevance is the proportion of neighbours present in each layer compared
to the neighbourhood for each individual [@Berlingerio_2012]. Finally, we
calculated the similarity of layers between seasons, across landcover classes
(e.g. winter open compared to summer open) using the Pearson correlation
coefficient [@Br_dka_2018].



## Varying scale in multilayer networks
### Social scale

We altered the social scale based on visual (short distance) and auditory (long
distance) sensory modalities of caribou<!-- TODO: REF?-->. Specifically, we
modified the spatial distance threshold required for group assignment using
`spatsoc` [@Robitaille_2019] (see above) and re-assigned groups at incremental
distances between 5 - 500 m. For example, at the finest social scale, only
individuals within 5 m of one another were considered in the same group, whereas
at the coarsest social scale, individuals within 500 m of one another were
considered in the same group.

### Spatial scale

To assess the influence of spatial scale on multilayer networks, we aggregated
our landcover raster at varying scales relevant to caribou ecology. We
aggregated the 30 m landcover raster using the R package `grainchanger`
[@Graham_2019] at five scales: 100 m, 250 m, 500 m, and 1000 m. Aggregation
occurred using a modal moving window method using a circular window
corresponding to the above scales [@Graham_2019a]. We assume 30 m and 100 m
represents fine-scale decision making for caribou during foraging, while
re-sampling at 500 m and 1000 m represents the scale at which caribou tend to
select and avoid habitat (Bastille-Rousseau et al. 2017).


### Temporal scale
#### Time window length and position
We altered the temporal scale of multilayer networks by varying the length and
position of the time window used to define seasons. The length of the time
window varied from 40-100 days using a fixed start day for winter (starting at 1
January) and summer (starting at 3 August). The position of the time window was
shifted by 1-48 days, using a fixed time window length of 48 days. These new
time windows were iteratively used to partition data into two discrete seasons
(winter, summer) and generate multilayer networks.

#### Number of observations
Studies of social network analysis vary in the number and frequency of
observations as well as the data collection technique used to generate networks
[@Davis_2018; @Webber_2019]. In addition to altering the temporal scale by
adjusting the time window, we investigated the influence of the number of
observations on resulting multilayer networks. We randomly selected 500
timesteps and iteratively included 25 additional observations, regenerating the
multilayer network and calculating associations of individuals. Subsequent
iterations included the previous set of observations to mimic observational
data. <!-- TODO: bah conclude / this sentence falls off a cliff -->

# Scale in multilayer networks in practice: case study results and discussion
<!-- TODO: Add intro/general to results? with mention figures are means of inds-->
<!-- TODO: make sure we clarify these are means of all individuals? -->
<!-- TODO: discuss layer similarity for social threshold -->

In general, individuals in multilayer networks became more connected as social
scale increased; however, this relationship varied by habitat type and season.
As social scale increased, graph strength for winter networks increased to
~100-200 m thresholds, followed by a plateau, while graph strength for summer
networks did not change as the social threshold increased (Figure
\@ref(fig:socres)a). Layer relevance increased for winter networks between 5 and
50 m social thresholds, then did not change for any habitat types which suggests
the winter habitat layers captured most, if not all, of the potential
connections an individual would have across these networks (Figure
\@ref(fig:socres)b). <!-- missing summer--> Connective redundancy increased
rapidly when groups were formed up to ~100 m threshold, followed by
a plateau and slight decrease at higher thresholds, presumably due to an
increase in summer forest degree at ~500 m (Figure \@ref(fig:socres)d). Taken
together, these results suggest the optimal social scale at which groups should
be assigned is likely somewhere between ~20-100 m based on the rate at which
network metrics stabilized. For ungulates, groups are often assigned based on 50
m threshold (Lingle 2003; Lesmeries et al. 2018; Peignier et al. 2019),
suggesting that given similar quantities of data, ~50 m is likely an ideal
social scale for generating social networks in caribou and similar species.



Increasing the scale of landcover resolution resulted in decreased proportion of
rare and patchy habitats, and low connectivity of individuals in these habitats.
In winter, layer relevance was stable for open and forest habitats but decreased
for forage habitats (Figure \@ref(fig:lcres)b). Layer similarity was generally
stable for forest and open habitats except for a contrasting increase in
similarity for forest and decrease in similarity for open habitats 250 m
landcover resolution (Figure \@ref(fig:lcres)c). Layer similarity was not
possible to calculate between winter and summer forage because, at all landcover
resolutions greater than 30 m there were no individuals connected in the network
layers. <!-- individuals still used forage but in much lower proportion +
lowered opportunity to associate --> Connective redundancy decreased with
increasing landcover resolution due the decrease in connectivity of individuals
in winter forage habitats, resulting in a multilayer network where neighbours
were less frequently repeated in multiple layers <!-- TODO: I'm having a hard
time understanding this previous sentence --> (Figure\@ref(fig:lcres)d).  These
results indicate the importance of matching landcover resolution to scale of
selection as well as ensuring the landcover product used has a resolution fine
enough to detect relevant landscape features and habitats. <!-- TODO: how? This
isn't clear enough for me to follow yet -->



As the number of observations used to generate multilayer networks increased,
individuals became more connected and metrics generally appeared to stabilize.
Like coarse landcover resolution (above), low numbers of observations were not
sufficient for capturing individuals in all contexts and layer similarity could
not be calculated below approximately 75 observations for forest, approximately
210 observations for open and approximately 300 observations for forage (Figure
\@ref(fig:nobs)c). Once sufficient observations were obtained, layer similarity
stabilized for all three landcover classes at approximately 200 observations for
forest and approximately 300 observations for open and forage landcover types.
Connective redundancy increased with increasing number of observations as
individuals became more connected to neighbours in multiple layers (Figure
\@ref(fig:nobs)d). Given the overall trend of these multilayer metrics
stabilizing after a certain number of observations are included, the results
suggest this sensitivity method could be useful for determining the number of
observations necessary for sufficiently describing the social dynamics across
contexts. 

<!-- TODO: I'm not sure this is relevant since this is the main way it
is already done, can we make this thought more relevant to picking scales or
multilayer networks in general? I think it's important for building robust
networks -->



Contrasting winter and summer seasons became more similar with increasing window
length. Individual graph strength and layer relevance increased for all summer
layers as individuals became more connected with increasing window lengths
(Figure \@ref(fig:winlen)a, Figure \@ref(fig:winlen)b). Layer similarity between
seasons increased consistently across landcover class (Figure
\@ref(fig:winlen)b).  These results suggest that an increasing window length,
especially for the summer season, may be resulting in less precisely defined
seasons that are not clearly capturing periods of aggregation and
dissaggregation according to resource availability and presence of conspecifics.

layers at 50 m through 500 m while summer network layers had consistently weak

network layers between seasons (e.g. open summer compared to open winter)
showed different responses to changing landcover scale with an overall increase
in similarity for open layers and decrease in similarity for forage layers.
<!--TODO: what about forest.--> D) Mean connective redundancy across individuals

network metrics were calculated and we examined how network metrics changed as a

weaker during the summer compared to the winter months. B) Mean layer relevance
showed sparse connectivity in summer compared to winter networks and a decrease
in winter forage layer relevance at higher landcover resolutions. C) Similarity
of landcover network layers between seasons (e.g. open summer compared to open

# Perspectives  to advance multilayer networks 

The integration of behavioural and ecological theory has shown the value of
considering the importance of various ecological disciplines to better
understand and predict animal social networks, including demography (Shizuka and
Johnson 2019), evolutionary and quantitative genetics (Fisher and McAdam 2017),
disease ecology (Silk et al. 2017), and animal personality (Sih et al. 2017).
While the number of studies integrating social network theory into a broader
array of behavioural and ecological sub-disciplines is impressive, only recently
has the role of animal space use been considered in describing the causes and
consequences of the social environment in the context of (1) phenotypes and
individual fitness [@Webber_2018], (2) movement ecology and collective movement
[@Bode_2011], and (3) habitat selection and space use [@He_2019]. Importantly,
much of the work linking space use and the social environment has been
theoretical and empirical studies are lacking (but see Peignier et al. 2019;
Pinter-Wollman 2015; Strandburg-Peshkin et al. 2015; 2017). Here, we discuss the
role mutlilayer networks within the emerging integration of social and spatial
ecology within the behavioural ecology literature.

## Phenotypes and Individual fitness

Social network positions are frequently used to represent the social environment
that an individual experiences or their social phenotype. Multilayer networks
provide a way to bridge these different scales so that we can examine social
phenotypes in more holistic ways rather than looking at each scale separately as
has traditionally been done. From a monolayer network perspective, social
phenotypes are increasingly linked to important fitness for individuals of
various species, including primates [@Brent_2017; @Thompson_2019], dolphins
[@Stanton_2012; @Stanton_2011], and birds [@McDonald_2007; @Royle_2012]. Both
social scales, types of interactions, and temporal, seasons and stages of life,
have emerged as important for understanding fitness consequences in the context
of social network positions [@Almeling_2016; @Berger_2015; @Brent_2017;
@Holekamp_2011].


For instance, social scale is major consideration for social network analysis,
especially in the context of different types of relationships, such as grooming
and association, that are typically examined separately while answering a single
question [@Castles_2014; @Carter_2015; @Farine_2015a]. Furthermore, it is a
common trope that individuals must be associating to interact, and many studies
therefore assume that proximity is proxy for interacting [@Farine_2015a]. For
instance, baboons need to be in proximity to groom each other. However, animals
have certain interactions that do not require proximity such as long-distance
vocalization and olfactory signals [@Carter_2015] With the advancement of
biologging technology, we have the ability to record social interactions that do
not require proximity, particularly long-distance communication networks with
devices like microphone arrays [@Snijders_2017]. Using relocation data, our case
study results indicate that there are different social patterns in different
habitat types, likely indicating different types of interactions. When the
social threshold is greater than approximately 50 m during the winter,
individuals demonstrate dramatically different graph strength (Figure \@ref(fig:socres))
in different habitat types, having higher graph strength in
forage and open habitats where they can likely see each other and still interact
with visual cues than in forest habitats. Varying social scales can have
different fitness repercussions for individuals. Rhesus macaques (*Macaca
mulatta*) had higher survivorship when they had fewer but stronger, more stable
social associates and grooming partners rather than simply more associates
[@Ellis_2019]. This finding highlights that different qualities of social scales
have lasting consequences. Multilayer networks provide the opportunity to
address these types of questions involving social scale with all the individual
layers of interaction integrated in a holistic way.


Temporal scale is also important for understanding the repercussions of social
phenotypes. Varying the time window length and position for caribou, we found
there was a lot of variation in the multilayer network metrics (Figure \@ref(fig:winlen), Figure \@ref(fig:winpos)). 
These changes in the outcome depending on how the time window is
defined highlight how critical it is to properly define the time window
appropriately to address the questions and hypotheses of interest. For instance,
social phenotypes can change over ontogeny in ways that can affect fitness
[@Berger_2015; @Brent_2017]. Thus, it is critical to carefully consider the
temporal scale that is meaningful for the proposed hypotheses. Further
complicating the issue of selecting suitable time scales across ontogeny,
individuals progress through development at different rates [@Tarka_2018]. This
variation can make defining appropriate temporal scales for testing the fitness
implications of an individual’s social phenotype over different stages of
ontogeny even more difficult when they vary by individual. However, considering
fine temporal scales provide insight across developmental stages that may
otherwise be missed [@Turner_2017]. Defining temporal scales is a challenge in
multilayer networks just as in monolayer networks; however, multilayer networks
provide metrics that enable researchers to look at similarities and differences
in separate layers representing different stages of ontogeny, or seasons as in
our case study, which can be difficult to detect.


Multilayer networks provide unique opportunities and challenges, linking these
various scales, for understanding the social phenotypes and environments of
individuals and their fitness outcomes. The multilayer network framework enables
researchers to examine these different social scales simultaneously rather than
individually, which is what has been done under most circumstances, but is not
very realistic. Metrics from multilayer networks provide an opportunity to
simplify statistical models. Interactions that happen side-by-side, proximity
associations, and long-distance interactions can be encapsulated in a single
multilayer network, and a single metric can be used to describe the various
social scales of an individual’s network position. This multilevel network
metric could be used to assess the relationship between an individual’s social
phenotype and fitness. It would also be a meaningful simplification of many
network metrics that could help simplify statistical analyses and deal with the
frequent correlations between social network metrics in different types of
networks [@Castles_2014]. Furthermore, multilayer networks provide a framework
to test hypotheses linking social phenotypes and fitness across temporal scales.
Because of the non-independent nature of social interactions and associations,
especially over time, it is hard to test hypotheses about social dynamics with a
suitable null control [@Farine_2017; @Proskurnikov_2017]. Using the framework of
multilayer networks, making layers of different temporal periods provides a way
to make appropriate null models to test questions about the dynamics of an
individual’s social network position over multiple aggregated time periods.


Conversely, picking the proper temporal scale is important but a challenge
because all layers in the multilayer network should reflect the same time
period, and the period should be long enough for each layer to have enough data
for robust networks [@Farine_2017]. These considerations may be limiting factors
when answering questions that require timeframes that are relevant to different
individuals, for instance. In both mono- and multilayer networks, the effect of
scale on the relationship between an individual’s social network position and
fitness need to be considered based on the hypotheses being tested and
logistical constraints.


## Movement ecology and collective movement

Social processes, movement decisions, and space use are inextricably linked and
multilayer networks represent a potential analytical framework for linking these
processes [@Mourier_2019] (Mourier et al. 2019). Movement as a collective group
can reduce per capita predation risk via detection-dilution trade-offs and
improve information transfer about the quality or location of resources to other
group members [@Jolles_2019]. In our case study, we integrate proximity based
social networks that inherently rely on animal collective movement and, in
general, we found that movement is likely an important mechanism driving social
network connectivity within and between habitat types.

Although multilayer animal social networks are relatively novel [@Silk_2018],
movement behaviour within multilayer networks has been considered.  Spatial
networks are physical locations (nodes) which are connected in a network when
individuals move between said locations (edges). For example, spatial networks
were applied to monitor movement of sharks (*Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos* and
*Carcharhinus melanopterus*) between fixed location autonomous arrays. In this
example, nodes represent locations within the array, *intralayer edges*
represent individual movement frequency, and *interlayer edges* represent
contact probability among individuals at a given node [@Mourier_2019] (Mourier
et al. 2019). Although movement between fixed arrays is inherent, networks are
not constructed based on continuous measures of dyadic or collective movement
[@Long_2014]. Our case study builds on the work of Mourier et al. (2019) and
explicitly integrates continuous and simultaneous measures of animal movement
through space and time as layers of a multilayer social network.

In contrast to spatial networks, where nodes represent spatial locations that
are fixed in space, movement networks can represent continuous and simultaneous
movement trajectories of multiple animals. In a recent study of vulturine
gunieafowl (*Acryllium vulturinum*), GPS movement data were used to generate
monolayer association networks within a multilayer network [@Papageorgiou_2019].
However, despite potential to generate networks in different spatial or social
contexts, layers in the multilayer network represented social associations
within and between groups. Continuous collection of animal relocation data using
GPS technology can be used to measure how groups of animals make collective
movement decisions in the context of their local environment
[@Strandburg_Peshkin_2015; @Strandburg_Peshkin_2017] and across scales. A
collective movement layer could constitute similarity in movement for dyads
[@Long_2014] or groups  [@Bode_2011]. This movement layer could be made at a
fine [i.e. minute-to-minute: @Cleasby_2019] or coarse scale [global migration:
@Flack_2018]. Our case study integrates variation in temporal and spatial scale
to assess the role of scale in predicting multilayer networks. As one might
expect, we found increasing spatial scale results in saturation of potential
social connections (Figure 3), while increasing temporal scale had little effect
on habitat-specific networks (Figure 5). Another potential application would be
to generate social networks during times when animals are engaged in different
behaviours, including traveling, interacting, or foraging [@Muller_2018;
@Finn_2019] and construct a multilayer network based on behaviour-specific
monolayer networks [e.g. @Smith_Aguilar_2019].

Importantly, the key to incorporating movement in multilayer networks across
scales is the technological advancements available to overcome previous
limitations [@Hughey_2018]. Biologging and wildlife tracking technology has
advanced to the point where relocations can be programmed to occur as frequently
as each second [@Börger_2016], a practice which has been applied to questions of
collective movement [e.g @Strandburg_Peshkin_2015]. Meanwhile, remote sensing
technology, including unmanned aerial vehicles and satellites, can be used to
track the fine-scale movements of groups over large distances and time scales
[@Torney_2018]. Using technology to infer behaviour has therefore become
standard operating procedure for many species in many systems. Our ability to
collect and process remotely sensed data and infer social processes based on
animal movement provides an opportunity to use multilayer social network
analysis to answer complex questions about animal socioecology.

Given the existing framework for constructing multilayer networks from
behavioural layers [e.g. @Smith_Aguilar_2019], monolayer networks that explicity
quantify movement paramters could be itnegrated. For example, edges could
represent measures of dyadic or collective movement based on dynamic interaction
metrics [@Long_2014]. Integrating movement layers with habitat-specific social
association layers could further shed light on the role of movement as a driver
of the social and spatial environments an individual experiences [@Webber_2018].
In our case study, we generated multilayer networks based on habitat-specific
monolayers. Coordinated movement of dyads, or groups, could vary based on
habitat, and the approach we outline could be used to explore mechanisms linking
the social and spatial environments. For example, social processes may be an
emergent property of the landscape because animals aggregate at resources, such
as waterholes [@Chamaillé_Jammes_2008]. Movement to, from, or within habitat
patches  or territories can also contribute to the formation of the social
environment [@Spiegel_2016]. For example, in sleepy lizards (*Tiliqua rugosa*)
males interacted primarily at home range edges, presumably driving territorial
behaviour [@Spiegel_2018]. Incorporating movement ecology within a multilayer
network framework is a logical next step for a burgeoning field. In particular,
when association networks are habitat-specific, we suggest the integration of
movement and space use in multilayer networks provides novel insights into the
effects of habitat configuration on the formation of the social environment
[@He_2019].


## Habitat selection and space use
<!-- TODO: Gerard ‘openness’ paper -->
Social structure is influenced by resource availability and seasonality
[@Peignier_2019], configuration [@He_2019] and fragmentation [@Banks_2007].
Habitat selection, the disproportionate use of available resources or landscape
features by animals [@Manly_1993; @Boyce_1999], is a scale dependent process
[@Mayor_2009]. Combined, social structure and habitat selection are intimately
linked as individuals must share space to interact and the distribution of
resources influences group dynamics and home range size [@Webber_2018].
<!--Animals select habitats at multiple scales ... (Mayor)  Mayor scale -->
Multilayer networks represent a novel framework for considering the influence of
habitat selection and space use on sociality across scales.

<!-- McGarigal 2016 organisms select habitat at multiple scales, temporal spatial
should investigate scale dependency. linking ecological processes to scale eg foraging or predator-prey dynamics

-->

<!-- TODO: point to figure 1 -->
Habitat selection depends on the scale at which it is measured and a singular
scale is insufficient for generalizing across scales [@Mayor_2009]. Habitat
selection is measured using resource selection functions (RSFs), based on the
proportion of used and available resources for an animal [@Manly_1993;
@Boyce_1999]. Johnson (1980) identified four orders of habitat selection: (1)
the geographical range of a species, (2) the home range of an individual, (3)
the habitat patches within the home range and (4) specific resources within a
habitat patch. Moving past this hierarchical perspective, Mayor (2009)
reviewed types of scale relevant in measurement of habitat selection and recommend using a continuum of scales for identifying characteristic scales of selection. For example, @Mayor_2007 showed caribou selection for shallow snow across all sales and used to a continuum of scales to avoid bias from narrowing the measurements to scales assumed to be associated with certain behaviours.

The emergent relationship between habitat and sociality has been explored by the
distribution and phenology of resources and use of social information. Cougars
had increased home range overlap in regions with high hunting opportunity, a
proxy for resource richness [@Elbroch_2016]. Caribou showed seasonal differences
in sociality, where social associations were high in winter and contrastingly
low in summer when resource availability is homogenous [@Peigner_2019]. Bison
(*Bison bison*) showed stronger habitat selection when group size was larger and
avoidance of predation risk was a main factor contributing to their habitat
selection [@Fortin_2009]. These examples are implicitly multilayered, comparing sociality across contexts of seasonality or spatial context. <!--Despite these, *missing multilayer approach*.-->

-->

Multilayer networks can be used to explicitly consider habitat selection and sociality across scales. Animal social systems can be parsed by spatial contexts, defined, for example, by habitat types as in Figure \@ref(fig:lcres). The influence of resource phenology can be directly measured by differences in habitat selection and sociality across temporal layers. Habitat selection can be explicitly integrated using network layers defined by similarity of selection coefficients between individuals. These explicit integrations of habitat selection and sociality across social, spatial and temporal scales highlight the potential for novel insights from multilayer networks. 


# Conclusions

Multilayer networks remain a nascent but powerful tool in animal behavioural
ecology. We demonstrate novel analyses that vary social, spatial, and temporal
scale within a multilayer framework. In our caribou case study, we show that (1)
multilayer social networks can be, but are not always, scale dependent, and (2)
the use of multilayer networks could be useful for identifying habitat or
season-specific social processes. Our analyses of social, spatial, and temporal
scales in multilayer network framework highlight potential to identify scales at
which different properties of layers within a multilayer network show the most
variability. Furthermore, we discuss the potential integration of individual
phenotypes and fitness, collective movement, and habitat selection for future
analyses considering spatial ecology using multilayer networks.

<!-- Alec, I think you need to include a paragraph reflecting on the importance of scale and ~3 critical things we should take away from this (maybe especially in light of including spatial data?) -->

Multilayer networks are complicated in that they can incorporate data as varied
as social interactions, landscape features, and seasons, all of which exist at
different scales and units of measurement. Our analysis of caribou multilayer
networks incorporated high resolution GPS telemetry data and spatial landcover
data is grounded in the context of observed animal social networks, as the
scales we chose to explore (e.g., number of observations, sociality across space
and time) are ones that can be observed as has traditionally been done. Thus, we
highlight ways in which scale ought to be considered for both observed and
remotely-sensed data when building social networks. Furthermore, GPS telemetry
data provides a link between large scale landscape properties and fine scale
social interactions as animal movement occurs across the landscape, and when
taken into account with multiple individuals can indicate association patterns.
Thus, a layer incorporating relocation data could be a great boon linking
spatial and social layer in multilayer networks.
<!-- JWT: I'm having a hard time getting to where I want to go, but basically I want to highlight that using GPS relocation data is reflective of more traditional observed networks like they wanted when they accepted our abstract, and this provides opportunities for social networks, particularly multilayer networks. It may be easier to scale relocation data and other landscape variables and can link to smaller scale observed interactions, providing a bridge between different types of data. -->


Silk et al. (2018) summarized some key multilayer questions in animal behaviour research.
While these questions are important for linking animal behaviour and multilayer
networks, we summarize our perspectives on the future of multilayer networks
with an additional set of questions posed through the lens of spatial ecology
that are relevant to the promise and problem of scale in mutlilayer networks:

1. How do social phenotypes vary across social, temporal, and spatial scales and
differentially influence fitness? Are some scales better predictors for
different fitness metrics?
2. Why do individuals associate more strongly with certain conspecifics in some
habitats? What, if any, is the role of movement in the context of habitat
networks?
3. How, and why, does the spatial scale of perception influence, e.g. auditory,
visual, or chemotaxis, influence the  social environment? What is the role of
memory, and by extension social and spatial cognition, as animals navigate their
environment and make decisions about where to move next?
