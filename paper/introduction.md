# Introduction

Animal social systems are complex and multifaceted

traditionally, animal social systems are measured using direct
observation, telemetry or pit tags interactions, e.g. grooming,
aggression, etc, between individuals are quantified by simplified
measures and often lacking any indication of the spatial context of the
interaction

recently the multilayer has been used to

along with spatial variables, comes a large history of landscape ecology
exploring and evaluating sensitivity to scale

here we’ll use simulations to evaluate the impact of scale on social and
spatial variables to better understand it’s impact, implications in ML
networks

# Multilayer Networks

Multilayer networks combine network layers with interlayer edges

Two main types of multilayer networks exist: multiplex networks and
interconnected networks. Layers in multiplex networks consist of the
same entities with each layer representing either a different type of
interaction (as in multirelational networks) or a different time point
or window (as in temporal networks). Layers in interconnected networks
consist of the same or different entities with layers representing
different subsystems (as in networks of networks), different types of
entities (as in intercontextual networks), or different spatial
locations (as in spatial networks) (Finn et al. 2019).

Of these, we have identified multirelational networks, networks of
networks, intercontextual networks and spatial networks as likely to
have spatial and scale considerations

# Box 1: Types of spatiotemporally explicit data

Spatial data can be:

  - how associations are measured: e.g. spatsoc
  - how relocations are categorized: e.g. landcover

Multilayer networks incoroprate spatial variables in two ways:

1.  for determining association between individuals in a social system
2.  for characterizing the spatial context of social systems

For example, association between individuals can be determined using
georeferenced biologging devices such as radio‐frequency identification
tags, radiotelemetry, and global positioning system (GPS) devices.
Proximity based social networks (PBSNs) are association networks based
on close proximity between individuals (Spiegel et al. 2016).

The spatial context of social systems can be defined as all
